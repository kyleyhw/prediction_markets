# Metrics and Plot Interpretation

This guide explains the key metrics used in the analysis and how to interpret the visualizations generated by the dashboard.

## Key Metrics

### 1. Market Tightness (Implied Spread)
*   **Definition**: A measure of the cost of trading and market efficiency. It represents the gap between the best price to buy "Yes" and the best price to buy "No".
*   **Formula**:
    $$ \text{Spread} = 1.0 - (P_{Bid}(Yes) + P_{Bid}(No)) $$
    *   *Note*: In an ideal, frictionless market, buying both sides would cost exactly $1.00. In reality, you buy at the Ask price (higher) and sell at the Bid price (lower).
    *   If we only have Bid prices (the price you can sell at instantly), the sum is typically $< 1.00$. The difference is the spread.
*   **Interpretation**:
    *   **Near 0.0**: Extremely tight, efficient market. High liquidity.
    *   **> 0.05 (5 cents)**: Wide spread. Indicates low liquidity, high uncertainty, or high fees.
    *   **< 0.0 (Negative)**: Arbitrage opportunity! The market is "crossed" (e.g., you can sell both sides for $> 1.00$).

### 2. Liquidity
*   **Definition**: The amount of capital available to absorb buy/sell orders without significantly moving the price.
*   **What it shows**: A histogram of trading volume across markets.
*   **Interpretation**:
    *   A "long tail" to the right indicates a few "superstar" markets with massive volume (e.g., Elections, Major Finals).
    *   A cluster near zero indicates many "zombie" markets with little interest.

### 3. Liquidity Distribution (Log Scale)
*   **What it shows**: How much capital is resting in the order books.
*   **Interpretation**: Similar to volume, this helps identify which markets are actually tradeable.

### 4. Kalshi Market Tightness
*   **What it shows**: A histogram of the Implied Spread for Kalshi markets.
*   **Interpretation**:
    *   **Left-skewed (near 0)**: Healthy ecosystem.
    *   **Right-skewed**: Many illiquid markets.
