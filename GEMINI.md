# GEMINI Project Guidelines

## Security Warning
> [!CAUTION]
> **PUBLIC REPOSITORY NOTICE**
> This repository is public. **NEVER** commit or push private keys, API secrets, or `.env` files to the remote repository.

### Rules
1.  **Credentials:** All API keys and secrets must be stored in `.env` only.
2.  **Gitignore:** Ensure `.env` is always listed in `.gitignore`.
3.  **Review:** Double-check all files before committing to ensure no secrets are hardcoded.
