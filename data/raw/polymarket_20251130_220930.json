A 24h period of USDT below 98 cents that starts on the last day in 2025 will count.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is https://www.coinbase.com/, specifically the USDT-USD \u201cHigh\u201d prices currently available at https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/spot/USDT-USD with \u201c1m\u201d and \u201cCandles\u201d selected on the top bar.

If Coinbase stops having the necessary USDT information to resolve this market, a consensus of credible sources for whether USDT was below 98 cents for 24h+ may be used to resolve this market.",

    "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the Supreme Court of the United States grants certiorari in a case explicitly concerning the legality, regulation, or jurisdictional authority over sports event contracts by July 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nA case qualifies if it addresses at least one of the following: (1) whether contracts based on sporting event outcomes constitute regulated derivatives under the Commodity Exchange Act; (2) whether federal regulation via the Commodity Futures Trading Commission preempts state-level gambling laws as applied to such contracts; or (3) whether sports event contracts offered by federally licensed markets may legally be offered, restricted, or prohibited by federal or state authorities.\n\nThe certiorari grant must be publicly confirmed via the official SCOTUS docket or orders list, and verifiable through credible legal reporting or the Supreme Court\u2019s official website. The case does not need to be heard, scheduled, or decided to qualify. \n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus census of credible reporting. ",
