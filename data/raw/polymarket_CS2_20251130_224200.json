A 24h period of USDT below 98 cents that starts on the last day in 2025 will count.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is https://www.coinbase.com/, specifically the USDT-USD \u201cHigh\u201d prices currently available at https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/spot/USDT-USD with \u201c1m\u201d and \u201cCandles\u201d selected on the top bar.

If Coinbase stops having the necessary USDT information to resolve this market, a consensus of credible sources for whether USDT was below 98 cents for 24h+ may be used to resolve this market.",
